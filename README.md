AIOS, an LLM agent operating system, embeds large language model into operating systems (OS) as the brain of the OS, enabling an operating system ``with soul''---an important step towards AGI. AIOS is designed to optimize resource allocation, facilitate context switch across agents, enable concurrent execution of agents, provide tool service for agents, and maintain access control for agents.
